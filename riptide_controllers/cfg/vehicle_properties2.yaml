# This file aims to define the locations and other properties of 
# thrusters and the robot
# All dimensions in [m]

Properties: {
  Mass: 36.1, # [kg]
  Volume: 0.0386, # [m^3]
  COB: [0.0205, 0.0, -0.04], #[m]
  Inertia: [0.69, 2.62, 2.51], # [kg-m^2]
  # All thrusters were assumed to point in +x direction
  # 03/17: Data about yaw and pitch are for the old system
